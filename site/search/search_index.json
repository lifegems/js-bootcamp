Why may some hesitate to reach out for congregation privileges?  What steps would be included in progressively training a ministerial servant to qualify as an elder?  Why is it important to recognize differing abilities and gifts brothers may have? (1Co 12:4-7; 1Ti 3:10)  Why is delegating an essential part of training?  Why is it important that, when assigning a brother to a new responsibility, the elders also assign a brother to train him?

Why is it important to provide assistance to those who previously served as elders or ministerial servants?  In what ways could young sisters be encouraged?

According to James 5:19, 20 and Jude 22, 23, how do elders serving on judicial committees show that they are primarily shepherds of the flock?  What sins must be handled by a judicial committee?  What kind of evidence is acceptable to establish wrongdoing? (De 19:15; Joh 8:17)  How is a judicial committee formed?  What should be taken into consideration when meeting with the following individuals? \n  The accused is a sister with a believing husband. \n  The wrongdoer is a baptized minor with Christian parents. \n  An unbaptized minor with Christian parents is involved in wrongdoing.    What can each elder on a judicial committee do in preparation for the hearing?  Why is it important for those serving on judicial committees to treat the wrongdoer kindly and respectfully, never harshly?
